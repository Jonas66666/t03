# EcoPower TVs - Energy Efficiency Data Visualization

## Data Story

### Audience Analysis
The primary audience for this visualization consists of:
- **Australian homeowners and renters** interested in reducing energy costs
- **Environmentally conscious consumers** looking to minimize their carbon footprint
- **Budget-conscious families** seeking to lower electricity bills without sacrificing entertainment quality
- **Technology enthusiasts** who want to understand the energy implications of different TV technologies

These users are typically:
- Aged 25-65 with mid-to-upper level income
- Educated and digitally literate
- Making deliberate purchasing decisions based on both cost and environmental impact
- Interested in long-term savings rather than just upfront costs

### Key Audience Questions
1. How much can I save annually with an energy-efficient television?
2. What's the difference in energy consumption between TV technologies?
3. How do energy ratings translate to real-world cost savings?
4. Which TV models offer the best balance of features and efficiency?
5. What is the environmental impact of my television choice?

### Visualization Guidelines
Based on audience needs, the visualization will:
- Focus on cost savings and environmental impact
- Provide clear comparisons between technologies
- Use Australian dollars and metrics familiar to local consumers
- Highlight long-term savings versus upfront costs
- Make energy star ratings easily understandable
- Include real-world usage scenarios (hours per day, energy rates)

## About the Data

### Data Source
The energy consumption data presented in this visualization comes from multiple sources:
- **Australian Government Energy Rating Program** - Official energy star ratings and testing procedures
- **Manufacturer Specifications** - Published power consumption data from leading TV brands
- **Industry Reports** - Data from consumer electronics associations and energy efficiency organizations
- **Simulated Usage Models** - Calculations based on typical Australian viewing habits

### Data Processing
The data underwent several processing steps:
1. **Normalization** - All power consumption values converted to watts for comparison
2. **Cost Calculation** - Energy usage converted to annual cost using the Australian average electricity rate of $0.30 per kWh
3. **Usage Modeling** - Based on average Australian viewing habits of 5 hours per day
4. **Technology Categorization** - TVs grouped by display technology (LED, QLED, OLED, Plasma)
5. **Star Rating Alignment** - Energy ratings standardized to the Australian 6-star system

### Privacy
This visualization uses only aggregated, non-personal data:
- No individual consumer data is included
- All figures represent category averages rather than specific user information
- Manufacturer data is from publicly available specifications
- Energy cost calculations use publicly available average electricity rates

### Accuracy and Limitations
**Accuracy Considerations:**
- Energy consumption varies based on usage patterns, settings, and content
- Actual savings may differ based on individual electricity rates
- Manufacturer specifications represent laboratory conditions rather than real-world usage
- Technology is rapidly evolving, so newer models may have improved efficiency

**Limitations:**
- Does not account for regional variations in electricity costs
- Based on average usage patterns that may not reflect individual behavior
- Display technology categories contain variation between models and brands
- Does not include the energy cost of manufacturing or disposal

### Ethics
This visualization adheres to ethical guidelines by:
- Clearly stating data sources and methodology
- Providing appropriate context for all comparisons
- Avoiding exaggeration of energy savings claims
- Disclosing limitations of the data and analysis
- Maintaining transparency about calculations and assumptions
- Not promoting specific brands or models over others
